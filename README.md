# About

Hi there! My name is David and I'm a graduate with a bachelor's degree in Economics. As a data scientist in the making, I have a passion for using data to gain insights and make informed decisions.

My technical skills include proficiency in Python and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and others. Additionally, I have experience working with SQL databases and creating interactive dashboards using tools like PowerBI and Tableau. I also have experience with database design principles and have experience in data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have developed a strong foundation in statistics and econometrics, which has allowed me to develop a keen eye for identifying trends and patterns in data.

I'm constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in the field of data science. If you're interested in working together or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

# Portfolio Projects
In this section I will briefly describe my Data Analytics projects 
### Spam Filtering
- **Code**: [Link](https://github.com/DavidMilGitHub/Data-Analyst/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Spam%20Filtering/spam-filtering.ipynb)
- **Description**: The goal of this project is to develop an effective spam classification system using two popular machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project aims to tackle the problem of email spam detection by training models on a labeled dataset of emails, distinguishing between legitimate emails (ham) and unwanted spam emails.
- **Skills**: Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization, Text analytics, Feature Engineering, Predictive Analysis
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib
- **Results**: Predictive model that will categorize messages into spam and not spam.
