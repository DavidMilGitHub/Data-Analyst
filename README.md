# About

Hi there! My name is David and I'm a graduate with a bachelor's degree in Economics. As a data scientist in the making, I have a passion for using data to gain insights and make informed decisions.

My technical skills include proficiency in Python and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and others. Additionally, I have experience working with SQL databases and creating interactive dashboards using tools like PowerBI and Tableau. I also have experience with database design principles and have experience in data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have developed a strong foundation in statistics and econometrics, which has allowed me to develop a keen eye for identifying trends and patterns in data.

I'm constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in the field of data science. If you're interested in working together or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

# Portfolio Projects
In this section I will briefly describe my Data Analytics projects 

### Spam Filtering
- **Code**: [Link](https://github.com/DavidMilGitHub/Data-Analyst/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Spam%20Filtering/spam-filtering.ipynb)
- **Description**: The goal of this project is to develop an effective spam classification system using two popular machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project aims to tackle the problem of email spam detection by training models on a labeled dataset of emails, distinguishing between legitimate emails (ham) and unwanted spam emails.
- **Skills**: Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization, Text analytics, Feature Engineering, Predictive Analysis
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib
- **Results**: Predictive model that will categorize messages into spam and not spam.

### Car Selling Prices 
- **Code**: [Link](https://github.com/DavidMilGitHub/Data-Analyst/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Car%20Selling%20Price/car_selling_price_new.ipynb)
- **Description**: The Car Selling Price Prediction Model is a data-driven solution designed to estimate the selling price of used cars based on various factors. The project utilizes two popular machine learning algorithms, Random Forest Regression and Linear Regression, to develop accurate and reliable price prediction models and achieve 95% precision.
- **Skills**: Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization, Feature Engineering, Predictive Analysis, Machine Learning Models
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Regex, Sklearn
- **Results**: Predictive model that will predict the car selling price based on previously trained ML model.

### Ticketing System in PowerBi 
- **Code**: [Link](https://github.com/DavidMilGitHub/Data-Analyst/tree/main/PowerBI/Ticketing%20System%20Project)
- **Description**: The Ticketing System Dashboard is a comprehensive solution developed in Power BI that provides organizations with valuable insights and analytics related to their ticketing and issue management processes. This interactive and visually appealing dashboard allows users to track and monitor tickets, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- **Skills**: Data visualization, Interactive Features, SQL, KPIs
- **Technology**: PowerBI, SQL
- **Results**: Ticketing system provides organizations with valuable insights into the performance of their support team and allows them to make data-driven decisions to improve their customer service operations .
