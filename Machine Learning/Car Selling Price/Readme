The Car Selling Price Prediction Model is a data-driven solution developed in Python to estimate the selling price of used cars based on various factors. This project utilizes two popular machine learning algorithms, Random Forest Regression and Linear Regression, to create accurate and reliable price prediction models.

The model is built upon a dataset that includes relevant features such as the car's brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, number of previous owners, fuel type, and other specifications. By analyzing this dataset, the model learns the patterns and relationships between these features and the selling prices of cars.

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It constructs a collection of decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data, and then aggregates their predictions to generate the final result. This algorithm is particularly effective in handling complex datasets and capturing non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

Linear Regression, on the other hand, is a simple and interpretable algorithm that models the relationship between features and the target variable using a linear equation. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable and estimates the coefficients of the equation to minimize the prediction errors. Linear Regression is well-suited for datasets where the relationships between variables can be reasonably approximated by a straight line.
