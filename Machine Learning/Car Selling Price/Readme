A car selling price machine learning model is a type of predictive model that uses historical data to predict the selling price of a car. The model is trained on a dataset that includes features such as make and model, year, odometer reading, transmission, and engine type, among others. The model uses this information to build a relationship between the features and the target variable, which is the selling price. The model can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data by inputting the relevant features. The goal of the model is to provide an accurate estimate of the selling price of a car, which can be useful for individuals looking to sell their car or for dealerships looking to price their inventory. The model can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the car market, which can help inform business decisions and guide future pricing strategies. In this model I have used a RandomForestClassifier as a chosen algorithm because it gave the best results.
