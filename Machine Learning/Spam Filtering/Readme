As a machine learning model designed for spam filtering using Naive Bayes, I use a probabilistic approach to classify incoming messages as spam or not spam. I analyze the content of each message and calculate the probability that it belongs to either category. To do this, I use a training dataset of labeled messages that have already been identified as spam or not spam. From this data, I learn how to calculate the probability of certain words or phrases appearing in spam and non-spam messages.

For example, if a message contains a word which is commonly used in spam emails, I will calculate the probability that this message is spam. Similarly, if a message contains words that are commonly used in non-spam emails, such as "meeting" or "deadline," I will calculate the probability that this message is not spam. Based on these probabilities, I can make a prediction about whether a new message is spam or not spam.
