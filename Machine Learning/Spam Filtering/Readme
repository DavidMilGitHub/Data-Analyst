The goal of this project is to develop an effective spam classification system using two popular machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project aims to tackle the problem of email spam detection by training models on a labeled dataset of emails, distinguishing between legitimate emails (ham) and unwanted spam emails.

The project will start by performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the characteristics of spam and ham emails. This analysis will involve data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction to prepare the data for the machine learning models.

The first approach will be to implement a spam classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that calculates the conditional probabilities of each word occurring in spam and ham emails, allowing it to make predictions based on these probabilities. The model will be trained on a training set and evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The second approach will involve building a spam classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVM is a powerful algorithm that aims to find an optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space to separate spam and ham emails. The SVM model will be trained using different kernel functions and hyperparameters to find the best configuration for the given dataset. Similar to the Naive Bayes model, the SVM model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics.

The project will compare the performance of the Naive Bayes and SVM models, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses in the context of spam classification. The evaluation metrics will provide insights into each model's accuracy and effectiveness in identifying spam emails while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Furthermore, the project will explore techniques for model optimization and improvement. This may involve feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and potentially incorporating additional techniques such as ensemble learning or feature engineering to enhance the models' performance.

Overall, this project aims to develop and compare two spam classification models based on Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The project will not only provide insights into the effectiveness of these algorithms for spam detection but also offer valuable knowledge and experience in machine learning, text classification, and data analysis in the context of email spam filtering.
