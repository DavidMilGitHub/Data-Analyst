We will perform a complete Exploratory Data Analysis of the FIFA 2019. We will be observing the best players, bets teams, we will make our best teams and try to access players on the basis of there ratings. First we will do some simple visualisation that shows some correlations then we will visualise some distributions like age, skills etc. Lastly we will find the top players and see which club do they play, which country etc.
