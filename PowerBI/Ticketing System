A ticketing system dashboard is a type of software application that is used to manage and track customer support requests, also known as "tickets".
These requests can be generated by customers through various channels, such as email, phone, or an online form.The dashboard provides a visual representation of the status of these tickets, allowing support team members to easily see which tickets are open, closed, or in progress. 
It may also provide information about the average time it takes to resolve a ticket, which can be helpful in identifying areas where the support process may be inefficient or could be improved.
In addition to tracking the status of tickets, a ticketing system dashboard may also provide tools for managing and organizing the support process. This may include features such as the ability to assign tickets to specific team members, set priorities, and track the progress of tickets through various stages of the support process.
Overall, the purpose of a ticketing system dashboard is to provide a centralized and organized system for managing customer support requests, enabling support teams to more efficiently and effectively resolve issues and improve the customer experience.
