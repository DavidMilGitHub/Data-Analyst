      {
        "question": "What role does electrical bonding and earthing play in piping design and installation?",
        "answer": "Electrical bonding and earthing are important safety measures in piping design. They help prevent the buildup of static electricity or the risk of electrical sparks that could ignite flammable materials or gases being transported through the piping. Proper bonding and earthing ensure that any electrical charges are safely dissipated, reducing the risk of fire or explosion hazards. (Section 9.6.2q)"

These windows dictate the frequency of post-certification testing and inspections to ensure ongoing compliance. (Section 11.2.14)"
