The interpretation and application of Cl.3.3 shall be as follows: a. Subject to the provisions of Cl.3.3.1b. and any other expressed provision to the contrary, any reference to a building of which an element of structure forms a part means the building or (if the building is divided into compartments) any compartment of the building, for which the element forms a part. b. Any reference to height means the height of a building, but if any part of the building is completely separated throughout its height both above and below ground from all other parts by a compartment wall or compartment walls in the same continuous vertical plane, any reference to height in relation to that part means the height solely of that part.
